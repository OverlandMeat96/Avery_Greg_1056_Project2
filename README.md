# Project 2: Web Typography

This is the my web page for Project 2. This page includes two different font family's, "Bahnschrift" and "Oleo Script", with the backup font being "Arial". All of the fonts can be found in google font, but are also included with the files. All the images and text are from the Muskoka Brewing  website and are owned by them.

### Getting Started
This is a basic HTML / CSS / JavaScript build.

To view the page, clone this to the location of your choice, and open the ".html" file.

You can also view the source code by opening it in any code editing program of your choice, or clicking inspect in a chrome tab.
